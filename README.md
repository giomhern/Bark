This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and [Supabase](https://supabase.com).

## Running the production build

Navigate to [https://bark-iota.vercel.app](https://bark-iota.vercel.app) within your favorite browser and the result will show up!

## Running the development server

First, start by installing any required dependencies:

```bash
npm install

```

Then, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Keep in mind that this won't work completely due to the production settings of OAuth apps in Github and the URL configuration.
